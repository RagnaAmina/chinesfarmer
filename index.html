     <h1>The Story</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q> “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” The farmer said, <em>“Maybe.”</em> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<q> “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” </q>The farmer again said, <em>“Maybe.”</em>
    
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. </q> The neighbors then said, <q>“Oh dear, that’s too <d>Bad</d>,” and the farmer responded, <em>“Maybe </em>.”</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>“Isn’t that great!” </q> Again, he said, <em>“Maybe.”</em>
        
        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <a class="good" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/good">Good</a> or <a class="Bad" href ="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bad">Bad</a> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <a class="good" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/good">Good</a>  fortune.

        <a class="good" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/good">Good</a> and <a class="Bad" href ="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bad">Bad</a> are just one perspective.
